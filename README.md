# DSACommit_RadhinLaxmanPraveen
Structured DSA problem-solving with clean explanations, optimised solutions, and daily commits — building  logic and critical thinking one problem at a time.

Hi! I’m Radhin Laxman Praveen, an engineering student passionate about developing strong problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills through practising Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

This repository is my DSA journey journal — a collection of problems I solve daily to sharpen my coding logic, optimise solutions, and deepen my understanding of algorithms.

Each problem folder contains:
- A clear problem statement  
- Step-by-step explanation of the approach  
- Well-commented C++ code  
- Complexity analysis  

I commit my progress **daily** to build consistent habits and track my growth as a programmer.

## Why This Repository?

- To document my learning journey in DSA  
- To build a habit of solving and explaining problems regularly  
- To maintain a clean, organised, and professional codebase for future reference and interviews  

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- Solutions to classic and challenging DSA problems  
- Both brute force and optimised approaches  
- Detailed READMES explaining thought processes and code logic

I’m excited to share my growth here and welcome feedback from the developer community!
