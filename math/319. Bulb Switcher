319. Bulb Switcher


ðŸ’¡ The Bulb Problem: What's Happening?
You have n bulbs, all OFF initially.

In round i, you toggle (switch ON if OFF, OFF if ON) every i-th bulb.

So, bulb 1 is toggled in every round (since every number divides 1).

Bulb 2 is toggled in rounds 1 and 2.

Bulb 3 is toggled in rounds 1 and 3.

...

Bulb 6 is toggled in rounds: 1, 2, 3, and 6.

public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return sqrt(n);
    }
